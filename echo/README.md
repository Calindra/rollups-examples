# Simple Echo DApp

This example shows how to build and interact with a minimalistic Cartesi Rollups application that simply copies (or "echoes") each input received as a corresponding output notice. This DApp's back-end is written in Python.

## Building the environment

To run the echo example, clone the repository as follows:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples.git
```

Then, build the back-end for the echo example:

```shell
$ cd rollups-examples/echo
$ make machine
```

## Running the environment

In order to start the containers in production mode, simply run:

```shell
$ docker-compose up --build
```

_Note:_ If you decide to use [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/), make sure you set the [compatibility flag](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command-compatibility/) when executing the command (e.g., `docker compose --compatibility up`).

Allow some time for the infrastructure to be ready.
How much will depend on your system, but after some time showing the error `"concurrent call in session"`, eventually the container logs will repeatedly show the following:

```shell
server_manager_1      | Received GetVersion
server_manager_1      | Received GetStatus
server_manager_1      |   default_rollups_id
server_manager_1      | Received GetSessionStatus for session default_rollups_id
server_manager_1      |   0
server_manager_1      | Received GetEpochStatus for session default_rollups_id epoch 0
```

To stop the containers, first end the process with `Ctrl + C`.
Then, remove the containers and associated volumes by executing:

```shell
$ docker-compose down -v
```

## Interacting with the application

With the infrastructure in place, go to a separate terminal window and send an input as follows:

```shell
$ docker exec echo_hardhat_1 npx hardhat --network localhost echo:addInput --input "0x636172746573690D0A"
```

The input will have been accepted when you receive a response similar to the following one:

```shell
Added input '0x636172746573690D0A' to epoch '0' (timestamp: 1640643170, signer: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266, tx: 0x31d7e9e810d8702196623837b8512097786b544a4b5ffb52f693b9ff7d424147)
```

In order to verify the notices generated by your inputs, run the command:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "query" : "query getNotice { GetNotice( query: { session_id: \"default_rollups_id\", epoch_index: \"0\", input_index: \"0\" } ) { session_id epoch_index input_index notice_index payload } }" }'
```

The response should be something like this:

```shell
{"data":{"GetNotice":[{"session_id":"default_rollups_id","epoch_index":"0","input_index":"0","notice_index":"0","payload":"63617274657369da"}]}}
```

## Advancing time

To advance time, in order to simulate the passing of epochs, run:

```shell
$ docker exec echo_hardhat_1 npx hardhat --network localhost util:advanceTime --seconds 864010
```

## Running the environment in host mode

When developing an application, it is often important to easily test and debug it. For that matter, it is possible to run the Cartesi Rollups environment in [host mode](../README.md#host-mode), so that the DApp's back-end can be executed directly on the host machine, allowing it to be debugged using regular development tools such as an IDE.

To start the Cartesi Rollups containers in host mode, type the following command:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose-host.yml up --build
```

Conversely, to stop the containers removing any associated volumes, execute:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose-host.yml down -v
```
