# Simple Echo DApp

This example shows how to interact through the Cartesi Rollups with a Simple Echo DApp written in Python that is running inside a Cartesi Machine.
The goal of this example is to show how to send inputs to the DApp and check if they were processed.

## Building the Environment

To run the echo example, clone the repository as follows:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples.git
```

Then, build the backend for the echo example:

```shell
$ cd rollups-examples/echo
$ make machine
```

_Note:_ The backend implements the API specified by the [Cartesi OpenAPI interface](https://github.com/cartesi/openapi-interfaces/blob/master/dapp.yaml).

## Running the Environment

In order to start the containers, simply run:

```shell
$ docker-compose up --build
```

_Note:_ If you decide to use [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/), make sure you set the [compatibility flag](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command-compatibility/) when executing the command (e.g., `docker compose --compatibility up`).

Allow some time for the infrastructure to be ready.
How much will depend on your machine, but after some time showing the error `"concurrent call in session"`, eventually the container logs will show the following:

```shell
state_server_1        | Got a request from Some(172.25.0.7:33636), initial state: ["0x0","0xa513e6e4b8f2a923d98304ec87f64353c4d5c853"]

server_manager_1      |   0
server_manager_1      | Received GetEpochStatus for session default_rollups_id epoch 0
```

With the infrastructure in place, go to the second terminal window and send an input as follows:

```shell
$ docker exec echo_hardhat_1 npx hardhat --network localhost echo:addInput --input "0x636172746573690D0A"
```

The input will have been accepted when you receive a response similar to:

```shell
Added input '0x636172746573690D0A' to epoch '0' (timestamp: 1640643170, signer: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266, tx: 0x31d7e9e810d8702196623837b8512097786b544a4b5ffb52f693b9ff7d424147)
```

In order to verify the notices generated by your inputs, run the command:

```shell
$ curl -v http://localhost:4000/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "query" : "query getNotice { GetNotice( query: { session_id: \"default_rollups_id\", epoch_index: \"0\", input_index: \"0\" } ) { session_id epoch_index input_index notice_index payload } }" }'
```

The response should be something like:

```shell
*   Trying ::1:4000...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 4000 (#0)
> POST /graphql HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:4000
> User-Agent: curl/7.77.0

{"data":{"GetNotice":[{"session_id":"default_rollups_id","epoch_index":"0","input_index":"0","notice_index":"0","payload":"63617274657369da"}]}}
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
```

To stop the containers, first end the process with `Ctrl + C`.
Then, remove the volumes as follows:

```shell
$ docker-compose down --volumes
```

_Note_: The HTTP API uses two different ports, to receive and send information.
They're respectively: `5002` and `5003`.

## Advancing Time

To advance time, in order to simulate the passing of epochs, run:

```shell
$ docker exec echo_hardhat_1 npx hardhat --network localhost util:advanceTime --seconds 864010
```
